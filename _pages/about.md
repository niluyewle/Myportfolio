- **Develop & integrate a robotics-based solution:** I believe that intelligently incorporated mobile robotics can provide a valid solution to our major challenges while deepening human-robot collaboration. Moreover, solar-powered, indefatigable, and multiple small robots (swarm robots) are more resilient to unfavorable weather conditions and would bring a paradigm shift in current agricultural practices. Therefore, we aim to ***mesh robotic technology*** with conventional and non-conventional food production.

- **Develop & integrate the precision Ag technologies:** Today's cropping systems are characterized by intensive and uniform crop input application, which is environmentally unsustainable and often costly. Thus, I aim to develop & integrate precision Ag technologies (equipped with advanced sensors, robots, and data) for input optimization & site-specific operation that is critical in reducing environmental footprints and costs.


- **Employ & harness the potential of AI:** AI has untapped capabilities to answer the Ag system problems and make meaningful decisions from data. I aim to introduce & implement AI in conventional Ag machines and mobile robots.
